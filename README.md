# Fall 2020 Principles of Databases — Assignment 2

* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**  
* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**  

## ❖・Introduction・❖
In this assignment, you’ll work in two languages: XML and JSON; one will mirror the other. For the XML part, you’ll create an XML document that represents students at a university, and you’ll author a grammar, via a DTD document, that will define the language of your XML document.

You’ll then convert the XML to its JSON equivalent.

---

## ❖・Details・❖
Your student is comprised of the following:

* First name
* Middle name
* Last name
* Preferred name
* Student ID
* Email
* Phone
* Status (first year, second year, etc)
* GPA
* Major
* Minor
* Status (full-time, part-time, graduated, withdrawn)
* Advisor
* Date of initial enrollment
* Graduation date

---

## ❖・Rules・❖
### General
* Indent uniformly using 2, 3, or 4 spaces.
* Don’t mix tabs and spaces.
* Populate the XML and JSON documents with two distinct people who have the same first and last names.
* Implement the JSON and XML independently, then compare, as one will likely be more logical than the other.

### XML Section
* All your XML goes in `xml/index.xml`. DONE
* All your CSS goes in `xml/css/style.css`. DONE
* Your DTD goes in `xml/dtd/student.dtd`. DONE
* Comment every line of your DTD. DONE
* Author the DTD on your own; no help from WebStorm. DONE
* Style your XML using CSS so it’s easy to read in the browser. DONE
* Expose any XML attribute to the front end using CSS’s [`content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property and [`attr()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr) function. DONE

### JSON
* Validate your JSON directly in your editor and/or at [jslint.com](http://jslint.com/). JSON: good.
